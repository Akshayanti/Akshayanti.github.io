title: "Estimating POS Annotation Consistency of Different Treebanks in a Language"
---

## 19th International Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories (TLT 2020)
[Akshay Aggarwal], and [Daniel Zeman]

### Abstract

We introduce a new symmetric measure (called θpos)
that utilises the non-symmetric KLcpos3 measure (Rosa and Žabokrtský, 2015) to
allow us to compare the annotation consistency between different treebanks
of a given language, annotated under the same guidelines. We can set a
threshold for this new measure so that a pair of treebanks can be
considered harmonious in their annotation if θpos does not
surpass the threshold. For the calculation of the threshold, we estimate
the effects of (i) the size variation, and (ii) the genre variation in the
considered pair of treebanks. The estimations are based on data from
treebanks of distinct language families, making the threshold less
dependent on the properties of individual languages. We demonstrate the
utility of the proposed measure by listing the treebanks in Universal
Dependencies version 2.5 (UDv2.5) (Zeman et al., 2019) data that are annotated
consistently with other treebanks of the same language. However, the
measure could be used to assess inter-treebank annotation consistency under
other (non-UD) annotation guidelines as well.
